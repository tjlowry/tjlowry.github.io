# DATA SCIENTIST

:::{.columns .gx-5}
:::{.column width="60%" .px-4}
I'm a Data Science student at BYU-Idaho passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. With a minor in Accounting and a Machine Learning Certificate, I hope to bridge the gap between business and statistics.

At BYU-Idaho, I serve as both a TA/Tutor in the Mathematics Department and Team Lead at the McKay Maclab, which has strengthened my skills in programming, statistics, and leadership.

After graduating in April 2025, I'll be continuing my education at Texas A&M for a Master's in Statistical Data Science.
