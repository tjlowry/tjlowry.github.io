# My Journey

I'm currently pursuing my BS in Data Science at BYU-Idaho, with a minor in Accounting and a Machine Learning Certificate. My journey in tech has been driven by a fascination with turning complex data into meaningful insights. I believe that by learning accounting, the language of business, I will be able to learn even more from data.

## What I'm Passionate About

As a Machine Learning Engineer and Developer, I love tackling challenges that combine data science with practical applications. Whether it's developing sales forecasting models or optimizing database performance, I enjoy seeing how data can drive real business impact.

## Current Role

At BYU-Idaho, I serve as both a TA/Tutor in the Mathematics Department and Team Lead at the McKay Maclab. I get to combine my technical skills with leadership, whether I'm helping students grasp programming concepts or leading development projects.

## Beyond the Code

When I am not working with data, I love to spend time with my wife and our adopted cat George, a stray we found as a kitten in a California warehouse. I am a huge sports fan and root for all the Arizona-based sports teams even though I'm from San Antonio, TX. I became a fan through my mom, who grew up in Arizona. Some other hobbies of mine are 3d printing, history, and sci-fi.
