# DATA SCIENTIST

:::{.columns .gx-5}
:::{.column width="60%" .px-4}
I'm a graduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Master's in Data Science with a focus on statistics. I am passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I believe the best preparation for the rapidly evolving AI/ML landscape is developing a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical foundations. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at BYU-Idaho in Data Science with a minor in Accounting and Machine Learning Certificate, giving me a unique perspective that bridges business understanding with statistical rigor.

During my undergraduate studies, I served as both a TA/Tutor in the Mathematics Department and Team Lead at the McKay Maclab, which strengthened my skills in programming, statistics, and leadership.

My experience spans machine learning engineering, time series forecasting, and building user-friendly analytics tools. I'm particularly interested in applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning to solve real-world problems in finance and business.
