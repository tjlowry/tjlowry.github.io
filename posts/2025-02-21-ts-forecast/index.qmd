# Time Series Forecasting: First Models in R and Python

In my last post I talked about what time series forecasting is and introduced the concept of decompisition, both additive and multiplicative, and how we can see trends, seasonality, and other key things about our data. 

But before we jump into forecasting there are still a few more things I need to talk about that are essentials for a forecast to work.

## Data Cleaning
In this example I will use dataset from kaggle

## Our first model
For this first example I will be using a well know statistical approach called SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) This is built off of an ARIMA model, but includes seasonalility into the equation. 
## Python

### Libraries
you will need pandas, a plotting library of your choice, and 

## R

### Packages
